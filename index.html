    <h2>MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT</h2>
    <p>In Hyderabad, India, there is a popular restaurant called <b>Bawarchi Restaurant</b>.
        It is well-known for its Indian cuisine, especially its <b>Biryani</b>.
        South Asian meal called biryani is prepared using variety of flavorful spices.
        The atmosphere of the Bawarchi restaurant is typically laid back and ideal for families.
        It is renowned for emphasizing the provision of a cozy eating environment.
        My all-time favorite dish is biryani from Bawarchi because I enjoy the flavor, aroma, and spice of it.
