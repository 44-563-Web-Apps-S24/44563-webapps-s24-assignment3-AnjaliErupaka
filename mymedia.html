         I often listen to songs, and one of my favorite songs is 'gelupu thalupulu' song from the movie Theenmar. 
         It is a Telugu song, a language that is originated to the southern part of India. 
         This song was composed by Manisharma, and the lyrics were penned by Chandrabose. 
        This movie also has many notable tracks.           
        I usually love to hear this song, whenever I feel demotivated and alone. this song has a soothing music and beautiful lyrics. 
        I also suggested many of my friends about the song, and now we all love to hear the track

            Oye is one of my favorite movies.
            Shamili and Sidharth make up the primary cast of this film. 
            It's a sentimental film with heartwarming soundtracks and performances.

                <h3>DISPLAY THE CODE</h3>
                The OR command in SQL displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
                To get rows that satisfy at least one of the given conditions, you can combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause using the logical operator known as OR in SQL.
                If any of the conditions it connects to are true, the OR operator returns true.
                <pre>
                    SELECT column1, column2, ...
                    FROM table_name
                    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
                </pre>
